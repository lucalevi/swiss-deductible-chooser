<h1>About Insurek</h1>

<h2>What It Does – And Why It Matters</h2>
<p>
    <b>Insurek helps you save money on Swiss health insurance.</b><br>
    By entering your <b>monthly premiums</b> and by knowing your <b>average yearly health costs</b>, it indicates you
    which
    deductible
    (franchise) will cost the least overall.
    It’s quick, clear, and based on real Swiss insurance data.
</p>

<h2>Why You Can Trust It</h2>
<p>
    <b>Insurek uses pure mathematics and Swiss law rules</b> to calculate your optimal deductible:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We add up your <b>yearly premiums</b> (your monthly premium × 12)</li>
    <li>We calculate your <b>out-of-pocket costs</b> (up to your chosen deductible)</li>
    <li>We include the <b>10% co-insurance</b> (capped at CHF 700 by law)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The result? A clear comparison showing where you save the most. The math is transparent:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/lucalevi/swiss-deductible-chooser" target="insurek-algo">open-source code</a> is
        public on GitHub</li>
    <li>All calculations follow official Swiss health insurance regulations</li>
    <li>We don't store your data—everything runs in your browser</li>
    <li>The same math can be used by you, if you do the calculations by hands</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Want proof? Check your results against your own calculations. Our recommendations will align because math doesn't
    lie—it shows you
    the most cost-effective choice for your situation.

<h2>Who Made It – And Why</h2>
<p>
    Insurek is a personal project by <b>Luca Iacolettig</b>.
    When Luca lived in Switzerland, he struggled to choose the right deductible.
    He built Insurek so others wouldn’t waste time – or money – making the same mistake.
    You can read more about him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-iacolettig/"

<h3>More Questions?</h3>
<p>
    <b>Why is the website “.it” if it’s Swiss?</b><br>
    The domain <i>iacolettig.it</i> was available, so we used it.
    Here, <i>.it</i> stands for <i>Information Technology</i>, not “Italy.”
    That Luca happens to be Italian? Just a coincidence.
