<h1>Save on Swiss Health Insurance</h1>
<p><b>Choose the right deductible. Save hundreds every year.</b> Insurek finds the best deductible for you in minutes.
</p>

<h2>What is Insurek?</h2>
<p>Insurek is a personal project by me, Luca.
    I was frustrated with wasting time trying to find the best deductible in Switzerland,
    and this is a tool I made to automate the work. You can see <a
        href="https://github.com/lucalevi/swiss-deductible-chooser" target="insurek-algo">the algorithm on Github</a>.

<h2>How It Works ‚Äì 3 Easy Steps</h2>
<ol class="simple-steps">
    <li><b>Get your premiums:</b> from the official Swiss Premium Calculator.</li>
    <li><b>Enter the data:</b> Insurek shows the deductible that saves you the most.</li>
    <li><b>Know your yearly health costs:</b> average from the last 3 years.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 1 ‚Äì Get Your Premiums (Priminfo)</h2>
<p>Use the <b>Swiss Confederation Premium Calculator</b> (Priminfo) to find the six cheapest monthly premiums in your
    area.</p>

<h2>Step 3 ‚Äì Your Average Yearly Health Costs</h2>
<p>Take your medical bills (doctor visits, medicines, hospital stays ‚Äì <b>not insurance premiums</b>) from the last 3
    years.
    Add up the amounts of all bills and divide by 3.
    This average is needed to find the cheapest deductible.
</p>
<p>How? By comparing it with the break-even point found in the previous step.
    If your average yearly health costs are below the break-even point,
    you save money with the highest deductible. And if your costs are above it,
    the lowest deductible might be better.

<h1 class="about-end">About Insurek</h1>

<h2>What It Does ‚Äì And Why It Matters</h2>
<p>
    <b>Insurek helps you save money on Swiss health insurance.</b><br>
    By entering your <b>monthly premiums</b> and your <b>average yearly health costs</b>, it shows you which deductible
    (franchise) will cost the least overall.
    It‚Äôs quick, clear, and based on real Swiss insurance data.
</p>

<h2>How Swiss Health Insurance Works</h2>
<p>
    In Switzerland, <b>basic health insurance is mandatory for everyone</b>. You can freely choose the insurance company
    (like choosing a phone provider), but the coverage itself is defined by law and is the same everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    When you sign up, you also pick a <b>franchise (deductible)</b>. This is the amount you pay yourself before
    insurance
    starts covering most of the costs. Once you reach this amount, your insurer pays the bills, but you still contribute
    a small part (<b>10% co-insurance</b>, capped at CHF 700 per year).
</p>
<p>
    On top of this, you can choose <b>different models</b> to save money or get more services. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Hausarzt model</b>: you always visit your family doctor first.</li>
    <li><b>Telemedizin model</b>: you call a medical hotline before going to a doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These models often reduce your monthly premium.
</p>
<p>
    There are also <b>hospital stay categories</b>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Allgemein</b>: shared room, covered by basic insurance.</li>
    <li><b>Halbprivat</b>: two-bed room, often with choice of doctor.</li>
    <li><b>Privat</b>: private room and full freedom in choosing doctors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These options, along with dental insurance, alternative medicine, or private wards, belong to
    <b>supplementary insurance</b>. They‚Äôre optional add-ons for more comfort or flexibility.
</p>
<p>
    üëâ <b>In short:</b> basic insurance is mandatory and equal for all, but you can adjust your deductible,
    choose models, and add extras depending on your needs and budget.
</p>

<h2>Why You Can Trust It</h2>
<p>
    <b>Insurek uses pure mathematics and Swiss law rules</b> to calculate your optimal deductible:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We add up your <b>yearly premiums</b> (monthly premium √ó 12)</li>
    <li>We calculate your <b>out-of-pocket costs</b> (up to your chosen deductible)</li>
    <li>We include the <b>10% co-insurance</b> (capped at CHF 700 by law)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The result? A clear comparison showing where you save the most. The math is transparent:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/lucalevi/swiss-deductible-chooser" target="insurek-algo">open-source code</a> is
        public on GitHub</li>
    <li>All calculations follow official Swiss health insurance regulations</li>
    <li>We don‚Äôt store your data‚Äîeverything runs in your browser</li>
    <li>The same math can be used by you, if you calculate by hand</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Want proof? Compare your results with your own manual calculation. They‚Äôll match, because
    <b>math doesn‚Äôt lie</b>‚Äîit simply shows you the most cost-effective choice for your situation.
</p>

<h2>Who Made It ‚Äì And Why</h2>
<p>
    Insurek is a personal project by <b>Luca Iacolettig</b>.
    When Luca lived in Switzerland, he struggled to choose the right deductible.
    He built Insurek so others wouldn‚Äôt waste time‚Äîor money‚Äîmaking the same mistake.
